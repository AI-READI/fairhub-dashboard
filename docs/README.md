# Additional Documentation

Use this folder to write additional documentation for your project. This can be a simple way of additional technical details about the project(anything that wouldn't fit in your root level README.md)

You may also use this folder to organize other assets like images, text files, PDFs, etc.

Be sure to setup a table of contents in your root level README.md to link to any additional documentation you write.
